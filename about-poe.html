        <h2>Biographical Summary</h2>
        <p>Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American author, poet, editor, and literary critic, considered part of the American Romantic Movement.
	Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre. 
	He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of 
	science fiction.<a href="citation-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially 
	difficult life and career.<a href="citation-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

        </p>
       <p>Born in Boston, Poe was the second child of two actors. 
			His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of Richmond, Virginia. Although they never formally adopted him, Poe was with them well into young adulthood. 
		   Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts, 
		   including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of secondary education for the young man. Poe attended the University of 
		   Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted 
		   in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time his publishing career began, albeit humbly, with an anonymous 
		   collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to &ldquo;a Bostonian&rdquo;. With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. Later failing as an officer's cadet at West Point and declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, Poe parted ways with John Allan.</p>

        <p>Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next 
			several years working for literary journals and 
			periodicals, becoming known for his own style of 
			literary criticism. His work forced him to move among 
			several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and 
			New York City. In Baltimore in 1835, he married Virginia 
			Clemm, his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845 Poe 
			published his poem, &ldquo;The Raven&rdquo;, to instant success. 
			His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its 
			publication. For years, he had been planning to produce 
			his own journal, The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), 
			though he died before it could be produced. On October 7, 
			1849, at age 40, Poe died in Baltimore; the cause of his 
			death is unknown and has been variously attributed to 
			alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, 
			rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents.<a href="citation-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

        <p>Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields, such as cosmology and cryptography. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.</p>
